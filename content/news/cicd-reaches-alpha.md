As of today, the minimal functionalities of **Datapio OpenCore**, our CI/CD platform, are implemented.

Those functionalities includes:

 - project management
 - concurrent pipeline scheduling
 - pipeline as code, based on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

### What now?

The roadmap for the next year will be:

 - improving the code and design quality
 - full test and documentation coverage (free access for all our products)
 - developing our cloud infrastructure, in order to provide this CI/CD platform, and many more features, in a complete SaaS solution
 - looking for funding in order to improve our productivity and support
